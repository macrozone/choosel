This is RTD + Meteor istanbul code coverage tool that combines coverage from unit and end-to-end tests to give a true indication of test coverage.

It's a partial port of https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul-middleware/ and also uses code from https://github.com/tmeasday/meteor-router

Big Kudos to both of the above amazing coders.
